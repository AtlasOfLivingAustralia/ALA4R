Description: The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) provides tools to enable users
    of biodiversity information to find, access, combine and visualise data on
    Australian plants and animals; these have been made available from
    \url{http://ala.org.au/}. ALA4R provides a subset of the tools to be
    directly used within R. It enables the R community to directly access data
    and resources hosted by the ALA. Our goal is to enable outputs (e.g.
    observations of species) to be queried and output in a range of standard
    formats.
