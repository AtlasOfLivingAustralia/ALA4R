# ALA4R

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
options(width=120)
```

ALA4R enables the R community to directly access data hosted by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).

The ALA aggregates Australian biodiversity data from a range of sources, and makes the data freely available for scientists, policy makers, industry and the general public.

## Installing ALA4R

Development version from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ALA4R@dev")
```

On Linux you will first need to ensure that `libcurl` and `v8` (version <= 3.15) are installed on your system --- e.g. on Ubuntu/Debian, open a terminal and do:

```{sh eval=FALSE}
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libv8-3.14-dev
```
or install via the Software Centre.


## Using ALA4R

The ALA4R package must be loaded for each new R session:

```{r}
library(ALA4R)
```


## Example usage

First, check that we have some additional packages that we'll use in the examples, and install them if necessary.
```{r message=FALSE}
to_install <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "ozmaps", "sf")
to_install <- to_install[!sapply(to_install, requireNamespace, quietly=TRUE)]
if(length(to_install)>0)
    install.packages(to_install, repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")

## In these examples we use the `dplyr` package to help with data manipulation.
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ozmaps)
library(sf)
```

## Taxon information
Retrieve information for a taxon or taxa. For each taxon, provide a scientific name at one or more ranks, or an ALA taxon id.

The output of `ala_taxa()` can be used as the `taxon_id` parameter in other functions. 
```{r}
# A single taxa
ala_taxa("Dasyurus viverrinus")
```

`ala_taxa` can optionally include record counts for a taxon, and the child concepts of the supplied taxon.
```{r}
banksia <- ala_taxa(list(genus = "Banksia"), return_children = TRUE, include_counts = TRUE)

# Select only the species-level taxa, sort by count, and display the top 5
top5_banksia <- banksia %>% filter(rank == "species") %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  select(scientific_name, taxon_concept_id, count) %>%
  head(n = 5)

top5_banksia
```


Use `ala_taxa` to lookup a taxon id
```{r}
id <- "urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:d315deea-822c-4f2c-b439-da33d6af5fd6"
ala_taxa(term = id, term_type = "identifier")
```

## Occurrence data
Download occurrence data for a taxon. To download occurrence data you will need to specify your email in `ala_config()`. This email must be associated with an active ALA account.
To save your email for future sessions, set `preserve = TRUE`
```{r}
ala_config(email = "ala4r@ala.org.au", preserve = TRUE)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
occ <- read.csv("banksia.csv")
```

Download occurrence records for 5 Banksia species
```{r eval = FALSE}
occ <- ala_occurrences(taxon_id = top5_banksia)
```

```{r}
head(occ)
```


```{r eval = FALSE}
# build filters and columns
cols <- ala_columns(group = "basic", extra = "country")
filters <- ala_filters(list(year = seq(2000, 2020)))
occ <- ala_occurrences(taxon_id = top5_banksia,
                       columns = cols, filters = filters)
```


```{r}
filtered_occ <- occ %>% filter(country == "Australia")
head(filtered_occ)
```

Plot occurrence data using `ggplot`
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=100, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = ozmap_country) +
  geom_point(filtered_occ, mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude,
                                         colour = scientificName),size = .3)

```


## Customising searches
Occurrence searches can be narrowed down by area, a variety of filters, and data quality tests. 
```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Find all reptiles within a shapefile
id <- ala_taxa("Ornithorhynchus anatinus")
simple_shp <- st_cast(st_read('act_rect.shp'), "MULTIPOLYGON")

occ <- ala_occurrences(taxon_id = id, geometry = ala_geometry(area = simple_shp))
```

```{r include = FALSE}
occ <- read.csv("ornithorhynchus_anatinus.csv")
simple_shp <- st_cast(st_read('act_rect.shp'), "MULTIPOLYGON")
```

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = simple_shp) +
  geom_point(data = occ, mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude))

```

### Environmental layers
```{r}
# Get all layers relating to precipitation
layers <- ala_layers()
layers[grepl("precipitation", tolower(layers$description)),]$name

```

### Fields and categories
`ala_fields()` displays all the fields available for filtering and 

### Data quality profile
By default, the data quality profile is set to the ALA general.
```{r}
# List available data quality profiles
ala_data_profiles()

# List filters for a profile
ala_quality_filters("CSDM")
```

## Summary statistics
```{r}
# Total number of records in the ALA (with no data quality filters)
ala_counts()

# Total number of records, broken down by kindgom
ala_counts(breakdown = "kingdom")
```


## Media downloads
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Search for occurrences with images
filters <- ala_filters(list("multimedia" = "Image",
                                      basis_of_record = "HumanObservation"))
occ <- ala_occurrences(quoll$taxon_concept_id,
                       filters = filters)
images <- ala_media(head(occ$recordID, n = 5), download_dir = 'data/',
                    identifier_type = "occurrence")

# filter by licence type
images %>% filter(recognisedLicence == "CC BY-NC 4.0")
```


## Config

Various aspects of the ALA4R package can be customized.

### Caching
ALA4R can cache most results to local files. This means that if the same code is run multiple times, the second and subsequent iterations will be faster. This will also reduce load on the ALA servers.

By default, this caching is session-based, meaning that the local files are stored in a temporary directory that is automatically deleted when the R session is ended. This behaviour can be altered so that caching is permanent, by setting the caching directory to a non-temporary location. For example, under Windows, use something like:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ala_config(cache_directory="c:/mydata/ala_cache")
```

or for Linux:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ala_config(cache_directory="~/mydata/ala_cache")
```

Note that this directory must exist (you need to create it yourself).

All results will be stored in that cache directory and will be used from one session to the next. They won't be re-downloaded from the server unless the user specifically deletes those files or changes the caching setting to "refresh".

If you change the cache_directory to a permanent location, you may wish to add something like this to your .Rprofile file, so that it happens automatically each time the ALA4R package is loaded:

Caching can also be turned off entirely by:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ala_config(caching=FALSE)
```

or set to "refresh", meaning that the cached results will re-downloaded from the ALA servers and the cache updated. (This will happen for as long as caching is set to "refresh" --- so you may wish to switch back to normal "on" caching behaviour once you have updated your cache with the data you are working on).


### Debugging
If things aren't working as expected, more detail (particularly about web requests and caching behaviour) can be obtained by setting the `verbose` configuration option:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ala_config(verbose=TRUE)
```

### Setting the download reason
ALA requires that you provide a reason when downloading occurrence data (via the ALA4R `ala_occurrences()` function). The reason is set as "scientific research" by default, but you can change this using `ala_config`. See `ala_reasons()` for valid download reasons.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ala_config(download_reason_id=your_reason_id)
```
