#' Get list of taxa and their occurrence counts
#'
#' Retrieve a list of taxa matching a search query, within a spatial search area, or both.
#'
#' NOTE March 2017: the response object might include records with missing taxonomic information. This is an issue with the ALA server-side systems; see https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/bie-index/issues/134

#' @param taxon string: (optional) query of the form field:value (e.g. "genus:Heleioporus") or a free text search (e.g. "macropodidae").
#' For reliable results it is recommended to use a specific field where possible (see \code{ala_fields("occurrence_indexed")}
#' for valid fields). It is also good practice to quote the taxon name if it contains multiple words, for example
#' \code{taxon="taxon_name:\"Alaba vibex\""} (noting, however, that multi-word names are unlikely in the context of a specieslist
#' search, where one would typically be searching for all species within, say, a genus or family)
#' @param wkt string: WKT (well-known text) defining a polygon within which to limit taxon search, e.g. "POLYGON((140 -37,151 -37,151 -26,140 -26,140 -37))"
#' @param fq string: character string or vector of strings, specifying filters to be applied to the original query. These are of the form "INDEXEDFIELD:VALUE" e.g. "kingdom:Fungi". See \code{ala_fields("occurrence_indexed", as_is=TRUE)} for all the fields that are queryable. NOTE that fq matches are case-sensitive, but sometimes the entries in the fields are not consistent in terms of case (e.g. kingdom names "Fungi" and "Plantae" but "ANIMALIA"). fq matches are ANDed by default (e.g. c("field1:abc", "field2:def") will match records that have field1 value "abc" and field2 value "def"). To obtain OR behaviour, use the form c("field1:abc OR field2:def")
#' @return data frame of results, where each row is a taxon, its classification information, and its occurrence count
#' @seealso \code{\link{ala_fields}} for occurrence fields that are queryable via the \code{fq} parameter
