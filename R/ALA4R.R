#'
#' This project enables the R community to access data and tools hosted at the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA: http://www.ala.org.au). The goal is to enable outputs (e.g. observations of species) to be queried and output in standard formats for R. ALA4R is based around use of the extensive web services provided by the Atlas; see References.
